# Prediction Models Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects aimed at building predictive models for various datasets. Each project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The goal is to provide accurate predictions and insights using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
Each project in this repository follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity and reproducibility:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
  - Import and explore the dataset using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
  - Handle missing values through imputation techniques.
  - Perform data cleaning to remove duplicates and irrelevant features.
  - Apply feature scaling and normalization to ensure uniform data distribution.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships.
  - Use visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps).
  - Identify key features impacting the target variable.

- **Feature Engineering and Selection**
  - Create new features based on domain knowledge.
  - Apply encoding techniques to handle categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
  - Utilize Boruta for feature selection to identify the most relevant features impacting the target variable.
  - Evaluate feature importance using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance from tree-based models.

- **Model Building and Evaluation**
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Implement competing multiple regression models using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 
  - Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
  - Evaluate models based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score.

- **Model Deployment**
  - Save the best-performing model using joblib for future predictions.
  - Create a user-friendly interface using Flask (or Streamlit) for users to input features and get predictions.
  - Deploy the model to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud) for scalability and accessibility.
